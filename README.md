# Password Strength Checker

This password strength checker can be used by anyone to simply determine how strong their password is. It is meant to adhere to simple recommended password characteristics as stated by [Lafayette College](https://help.lafayette.edu/guidelines-for-strong-passwords/).

## Checker Characteristics
The characteristics of a good password set by Lafayette College are as follows -

At least 8 charactersâ€”the longer, the better

A mixture of both uppercase and lowercase letters

A mixture of letters and numbers

Inclusion of at least one special character, e.g., ! @ # ? ]


## Usage
The password checker works by rating passwords either: Very bad, bad, ok, good or very good. It is not the deciding factor of whether or not your password gets compromised, it is only meant to be used to analyse basic password security.

The checker is able to rate the passwords by allocating a point for each characteristic followed in a password. By doing this the program can transform the points into a rating which the user can use to try and make their password better, or just use that password.
